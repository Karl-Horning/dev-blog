    This is my second blog post, and yes, it's mostly here to help me test
    things. But testing is part of the process. Without it, you never know
    what's working until something <em>isn't</em>.
</p>

<p>I'm currently checking how the layout handles things like:</p>

<ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
    <li>Thumbnails</li>
    <li>Headings and paragraph spacing</li>
    <li>Responsive images</li>
    <li>Reading time calculations</li>
    <li>Sidebar listings and link styles</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">It Doesn't Have to Be Perfect</h2>

<p>
    This isn't meant to be profound or polished, just a small step to see how
    things display and whether updates I've made to the blog design are working
    across devices. I'll probably come back and tidy this post later (or not, if
    you're reading this in the future! ðŸ¤–).
</p>

    If you've stumbled across this post, hello! ðŸ‘‹ You've caught the blog
    mid-flight. Thanks for your patience while I bolt on bits of functionality
    and give things a coat of paint.

<p class="italic text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
    That's all for now. Back to testing.
