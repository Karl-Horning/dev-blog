<p class="mb-6">
    Welcome to my blog! I'm calling this the "first post", but really, it's a
    placeholder â€” something to test layouts and that lovely moment when a blank
    site becomes something more than a skeleton.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">That said, I thought I'd make it useful.</p>

<p class="mb-6">
    This site is my digital notebook, portfolio, and playground. Expect a mix of
    topics â€” from thoughts on learning technology and software development, to
    accessibility, to side projects that may or may not get finished (but are
    fun to build anyway).
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
    I'm building the blog with
    <a
        href="https://www.11ty.dev/"
        class="text-link"
        target="_blank"
        >Eleventy (11ty)</a
    >, a lightweight static site generator. It's fast, flexible, and â€” once you
    get the hang of it â€” satisfying to work with. I've paired it with Tailwind
    CSS to keep things clean and responsive.
</p>

<p class="mb-6">
    If you've stumbled across this while everything's still under construction,
    thanks for your patience! And if you're here on purpose: welcome. I hope you
    find something interesting!
